The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors.  The unexpected behavior occurs because the ID selector has higher specificity than the class selector, overriding the expected styling.:

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myElement {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myElement {
  color: green; /* This will override both #myElement and .myElement */
}
```

The element with both the ID "myElement" and the class "myElement" will unexpectedly be green, not red, as one might anticipate.
