This corrected CSS addresses the specificity issue by ensuring that the class selector's specificity is high enough to override the ID selector's style when applied to the same element.  This can be accomplished by adding a more specific class or using the `!important` flag (though less recommended for maintainability). Here is a possible solution using more specific classes:

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myElement {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myElementSpecific {
  color: green; /* Correctly overrides #myElement */
}
```

Here's an example using !important (less recommended):
```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myElement {
  color: red !important; /*Correctly overrides #myElement*/
}

#myElement.myElement {
  color: green;
}
```
